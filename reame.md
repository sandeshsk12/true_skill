This script processes data from a competitive coding platform to rank users based on their performance using a modified Elo rating system called TrueSkill. First, data from each challenge is loaded and preprocessed, considering only participants who completed at least one challenge. Then, for each participant, a 'Discord Handle' or 'xMetric Wallet' is used as identifiers. Each participant is initially assigned a default TrueSkill rating of 100. The TrueSkill ratings are then updated for each challenge using the 'rank' of the participants and the TrueSkill 'rate' function. If a participant's rating does not exist in the updated ratings data, a new row is added. In contrast, if it already exists, the existing rating is updated. All this information is gathered in a record with additional details like the project name, challenge link, end date of the challenge, and updated TrueSkill score and variance. Any exceptions during this process are caught, and the error along with the challenge URL is printed for debugging. The entire processed data is then stored as a DataFrame and saved to a CSV file for future reference. Overall, this script automates the process of rating and ranking coders based on their performance in coding challenges.
