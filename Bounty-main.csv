Axelar - 16. Axelar - Prime Protocol Launch,Season 4 - Batch 22,16,Intermediate,Axelar - Prime Protocol Launch,"Prime Protocol is web3’s first cross-chain native prime brokerage, allowing users to borrow assets on any chain backed by their complete portfolio of assets, powered by Axelar.

Earlier this month, Prime launched across Arbitrum, Avalanche and Ethereum Mainnet, with Moonbeam as its home chain. This means that users are able to deposit tokens into their portfolio and borrow tokens based on their portfolio value, across any of these four chains. 

Flipside currently does not support Moonbeam data; however, we would like to analyze Prime Protocol transactions across the 3 other enabled chains. Below you will find an example deposit of .1 ETH and borrow of .1 ETH on Arbitrum. Leveraging these transactions as a guide, as well as the list of Prime Protocol contracts on the other chains, also found below, please provide metrics on the following:

Open Analytics - 40. Avalanche,Season 4 - Batch 17,40,Intermediate,Avalanche,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Avalanche data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Solana - 17. Compressed NFTs,Season 4 - Batch 7,17,Advanced,Compressed NFTs,"Solana released compressed NFTs, a way to mint tokens at a fraction of the previous cost on Solana (and even cheaper than any other chain). This will allow creators to distribute significantly more NFTs and add interesting use cases to their products. Drip Haus has notably been dropping a massive amount of NFTs along with Dialect sticker pack mints. Next week Helium is arriving on Solana and will further adding to this number.

Create a dashboard highlighting this new trend on Solana, showing the cost that these products would have incurred if they were minting on other protocols like Ethereum or Polygon. Is this ""only possible on Solana"" right now? Which projects have minted the most NFTs and what have been their use cases so far? How do you see this trend developing in the near future?

"NEAR - 24. Circulating Supply: Locked, Staked and Liquid",Season 4 - Batch 5,24,Intermediate,"Circulating Supply: Locked, Staked and Liquid","The goal of this is to create a dashboard that breaks out the circulating supply of NEAR into staking, locked and liquid NEAR. You can use the circulating supply stat chart on the NEAR Explorer as a guide for total circulating balance https://explorer.near.org/stats .

We want to show net staked NEAR, net locked NEAR, and net liquid NEAR over time. The staked portion can be accomplished with the factstakingpool_balances table. Locked NEAR will need to be calculated by tracking funds disbursed by the contract lockup.near. An important note: locked NEAR may or may not be staked!

Ideally this dashboard will have an aggregated view of staked NEAR, locked NEAR, and liquid NEAR over time. This dashboard will also have 3 separate charts illustrating, locked, staked, and liquid NEAR over time. Lastly, this dashboard will have inflow/outflow for each locked, staked, and liquid NEAR over time.

Tips
Use the lockup.near address to determine gross locked NEAR.
An example workflow can be found in this contract address: https://nearblocks.io/address/edf7be8afbd206f6948daf68e79e83a5bfa0adbe.lockup.near
The first transaction on that contract  is an example of locking NEAR, with the first receipt including important metadata like the owner account and lockup period https://nearblocks.io/txns/83vSUu6qXhYBnwMD4SvCt3jqreBgc7fqJCorREyjq62p#execution

Open Analytics - 34. Near,Season 3 - Batch 63,34,Intermediate,Near,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Near data. 

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Open Analytics - 33. Optimism,Season 3 - Batch 62,33,Intermediate,Optimism,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Optimism data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Our task is to analyze the results of this campaign using data.

To do this, we will need to answer three key questions:

1. How has the average number of monthly users (with < $100k trading volume) changed before and after the campaign was launched? We will compare the data for the 3 months before and after the campaign started.
2. How much total fees have been generated for addresses with more than $100k trading volume per month since the campaign started up to the current date?
3. What are the top 5 markets (i.e. trading pairs) for trading volumes below and above $100k since the campaign started?

By answering these questions, we can determine whether the ""Free trading"" campaign has been successful in attracting new users and increasing trading volume. Let's use our data wizardry skills to analyze the data and gain valuable insights for dYdX.

Open Analytics - 32. Base,Season 3 - Batch 59,32,Beginner,Base,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Base data. 

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

EVM - 15. Avalanche Protocol or Project Dashboard,Season 3 - Batch 56,15,Beginner,Avalanche Protocol or Project Dashboard,"Use Flipside’s new fact_decoded_event_logs and ez_decoded_event_logs tables and build a dashboard covering either:
- one of the top 15 Avalanche projects by TVL featured on Defi Llama (https://defillama.com/chain/Avalanche), 
- a bridge into Avalanche, or
- a popular NFT marketplace.

Show the activity and usage of the protocol through the events. Some of the things to consider are the number of unique wallets, asset volumes, swaps, LP actions, or fees.  Build a dashboard you think the protocol and the ecosystem would find useful to use and monitor the usage of the protocol.

Tips
- Break out your sections into tabs if you are using the Flipside App.
- The factdecodedeventlogs and ezdecodedeventlogs are currently being backfilled and nearly complete, however not all event types are decoded at the moment. Make sure you are looking at protocol who’s events have been decoded at this moment!
- You must use the new factdecodedeventlogs and ezdecodedeventlogs tables

In the News - 20. Crypto & AI Integration Challenge,Season 3 - Batch 56,20,Beginner,Crypto & AI Integration Challenge,"""AI"" has been the buzzword lately, from the launch of stable diffusion to ChatGPT, its impact has been felt across various industries. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact of AI on crypto. To this end, we are launching a bounty that seeks to explore the intersection of crypto and AI.

To participate in this bounty, choose any protocol or decentralized application (dApp) that leverages AI, and answer the following questions:

- How does the protocol/dApp use AI technology, and what specific AI techniques or algorithms does it employ?
- What benefits does the integration of AI bring to the protocol/dApp, and how does it enhance its functionality or user experience?
- Are there any potential risks or limitations of using AI in the context of the protocol/dApp, if yes, how can they be addressed?

Bonus question: Compare the protocol/dApp that uses AI to another protocol/dApp that doesn't use AI but has similar functionality. How does the integration of AI enhance or detract from the user experience or the overall performance of the protocol/dApp compared to its non-AI counterpart? Are there any notable differences in terms of security, scalability, or efficiency between the two protocols/dApps?

Open Analytics - 28. Bitcoin,Season 3 - Batch 51,28,Intermediate,Bitcoin,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Bitcoin data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

EVM - 12. Finding the Good Ones: An Optimism Case Study,Season 3 - Batch 51,12,Intermediate,Finding the Good Ones: An Optimism Case Study,"Every crypto protocol wants to grow its users. The lure of an airdrop or the fun of a quest can attract users, but are the users “good” users? 

Let’s try to answer these questions using Optimism data. Optimism makes for a great case study because recently they’ve had an airdrop, and a questing program and they launched attestation station. Use the data from these three programs (see example queries using Flipside below) and other Optimism data of your choosing to explore the following topics:

Good Users: What makes a good user? (define metrics that identify good users)
Program Analysis: By your own definition of a good user, analyze the users of attestation station (all attesting contracts together & individual attesting contracts), quest participants (all quests together + individual quests) and the 2023 airdrop recipients.
Cross-Program Analysis: Also analyze good users across all 3 programs, i.e. you’re looking to be able to show things like “users who attested AND quested were more likely to be a good user than users who only quested”.
Airdrop Motivation: do you see any evidence that users who appeared to be good users before the airdrop have since decreased in quality?
Conclusion: If you were advising a new blockchain on how to acquire and retain users, based on your analysis here, what would you recommend? 

Your analysis does not need to be structured to exactly match the topics outlined above, instead you should use these topics to motivate your analysis and present your findings in a way that best summarizes your learnings and shows how you think people should be thinking about attracting and retaining quality users on a blockchain.

NEAR - 18. Social Segmentation,Season 3 - Batch 51,18,Intermediate,Social Segmentation,"Create a segmentation tool to help us understand the NEAR profiles of new users on Near.social. The intention is to allow users to select a new group of Near users based on when they joined then look at that group of users wallet behavior. Some suggested wallet profile categories:

- age of wallets
- Staking history, average amount staked, average number of times staking
- DEX swaps
- What % of users bridged assets into NEAR vs using a centralized exchange, which bridges & centralized exchanges are most popular.
- NEAR Social Activity
- Any other profiling information that you think would be useful about the user.

The suggested format of the dashboard is as follows:
- On the first tab of the dashboard, display the first chart of this dashboard(https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/forgash/social-near-PGgrGA) so a dashboard viewer can see what time period they would like to select new users from. On that first tab, have instructions that the viewer can use the first chart to guide and help them select a parameterized time range to choose what period of new wallets to look at.
- From there, have date range parameters where users can select what time period of the new near.social users they would like to look at the wallet segmentation for. The parameterized time range should only influence the selection of wallets based on when they first interacted with near social. Based on the selected group of wallets, create other tabs to look at the wallet profile criteria listed above. 

Basis of Payment:
To be eligible for payment.
1. The submission must be sent before the deadline indicated on the bounty page.

Off-Chain Analytics - 8. Box Office (American),Season 3 - Batch 45,8,Beginner,Box Office (American),"MetricsDAO seeks to broadcast not only on-chain data, but also freely available open-source data. This includes everything from data on sports, to traditional finance, to weather and climate, and more.

This week, we want you to submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using data on Hollywood! Specifically, on the (domestic, aka American) box office returns for recent films.

You can find queryable data at many sources. Here is a large repo of public data sets. We encourage you to find your own sources for this challenge! 

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

Off-chain bounty submissions can make use of various publishing tools, such as Jupiter Notebooks, Google Data Studio, Google Collab, Rpubs, Kaggle, and more.  Dashboards should be organized in a way that is presentable to a general audience.  When possible, the full code should be hidden from readers.

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title.
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc). Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Flash Challenge - 17. Blur Analysis,Season 3 - Batch 42,17,Intermediate,Blur Analysis,"Recently, Blur launched its native ERC-20 governance token, $BLUR, with a maximum supply of three billion. The token's launch has been eagerly anticipated, with airdrops given to platform users who traded NFTs on Ethereum in the months before Blur's launch and users who listed NFTs on Blur.

Why was the airdrop so successful? How did it affect the NFT activity? Did the recipients sell the token?

Create a dashboard that captures activity across metrics such as:
- Post-airdrop activity - Are top airdrop receivers dumping or accumulating?
- Is new capital entering? What volumes of $BLUR were purchased before/after the airdrop?
- Tokenomics - How concentrated is the current supply of $BLUR?
-  How does activity on Blur compare to other marketplaces before and after the airdrop?
- What trends can you identify in royalty payments on Blur, as compared to other marketplaces?
- Did the airdrop seem to affect NFT project floor prices? Did buying/selling increase after the airdrop?

Solana - 7. Bonding in Hades,Season 3 - Batch 40,7,Advanced,Bonding in Hades,"Hadeswap has been the talk of the town in Solana once again after making the surprise purchase of Solana Monkey Business to help with their pursuit towards building up their protocol owned liquidity and to drive governance value toward $Hades. Recently, Hadeswap implemented ""bonding"" which effectively sells your ownership of that NFT for a 30% discount in $Hades tokens. 

Phase 2 bonding ended 16 Feb 16:00 UTC. 
Show the distribution of wallets that bonded their NFTs for a discount in $Hades. How does the distribution look for each NFT collection? What percentage of wallets also bonded in phase 1? 
Is this driving new users into the protocol? Are the wallets that are bonding, also large holders of $Hades already? Did Phase 1 bonders mostly dump their $Hades emissions into the market? 

To combat the token emissions from both bonding and NFT staking, Hadeswap has been using fees collected to buy back $Hades and burn it. 
How do token burns compare to token emissions? How many unique buyers of $Hades are there? Is most of the token demand coming from the existing holder base and the ""buy back and burn"" strategy, or is there external demand (and at what token prices)? 
How do token emissions from ABC and Underworld NFTs compare to the decline in their floor prices? Have ABC holders been moving to Underworld due to identical emission rates but a cheaper floor price?

Off-Chain Analytics - 7. Inflation,Season 3 - Batch 40,7,Beginner,Inflation,"MetricsDAO seeks to broadcast not only on-chain data, but also freely available open-source data. This includes everything from data on sports, to traditional finance, to weather and climate, and more.
This week, we want you to submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using data on everyone’s favorite financial topic — inflation!

You can find queryable data at many sources. Here is a large repo of public data sets. We encourage you to find your own sources for this challenge!

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

Off-chain bounty submissions can make use of various publishing tools, such as Jupiter Notebooks, Google Data Studio, Google Collab, Rpubs, Kaggle, and more.  Dashboards should be organized in a way that is presentable to a general audience.  When possible, the full code should be hidden from readers.

How do you raise your dashboard score?

Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title.
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc). Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard

Axelar - 1. Do incentivized wAssets impact transfer volumes on Axelar?,Season 3 - Batch 37,1,Advanced,Do incentivized wAssets impact transfer volumes on Axelar?,"How do incentivized wAssets on Osmosis impact token transfer volumes for Axelar?

Background: Most ""wrapped"" assets (WETH, WMATIC, WBNB, WAVAX, etc.) arrive on Osmosis via the Axelar bridge. Osmosis governance decides how to incentivize liquidity pools containing these assets. In the past two months we have seen incentives pass for wMATIC, wBNB, and wAVAX.

Task: Examine the impact of “bootstrapping” proposals on Axelar bridge volumes and fees paid. Did they sufficiently incentivize users to transfer external assets into Osmosis via Axelar’s bridge, or were the assets deposited into the respective pools already on Osmosis. Analyze the results in aggregate and by asset.

Goal: Identify if Axelar should work with Osmosis to incentivize more wrapped assets, in order to increase volume over Satellite and Squid.

See https://twitter.com/FamousFoxFed/status/1623395701366394882?s=20&t=0VbGloGM8gGssZkI2j9x7A for the announcement and more details.

The NFT lending space on Solana has been picking up and gained popularity over time as a way to essentially gain leverage on NFTs as a borrower and gain yield on SOL as a lender. 
Compare Key Performance Indicators between the major NFT lending protocols out there (Citrus, Sharky, Frakt, Yawww). 
Who is gaining the most market share? 
Why would a user use one protocol over the other? 
What NFTs are most popular on each platform?

Due to the rise in the price of SOL in January, there has been more pressure applied to borrowers to pay back their loans. Some lenders have been forced to take in NFTs that are now priced in SOL lower than their set loan price. 
Is there a noticeable increase in default rate over the past month on NFT loans? 
Which protocol has had the most defaults, and which NFTs have caused the most defaults? 
Is there evidence that leverage is unwinding in the market right now?

How do you raise your dashboard score?

Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Open Analytics - 14. Osmosis,Season 3 - Batch 33,14,Intermediate,Osmosis,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Osmosis data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more (accurate) detail and the higher quality your dashboard (organization, method documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well.Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for a bounty)

Analysts in non-compliance with our policy on plagiarism may be exposed on Discord and see their xMetric slashed.

Off-Chain Analytics - 5. Open-Analytics: Tradfi,Season 3 - Batch 33,5,Intermediate,Open-Analytics: Tradfi,"MetricsDAO seeks to broadcast not only on-chain data, but also freely available open-source data. This includes everything from data on sports, to traditional finance, to weather and climate, and more.
This week, we want you to submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using data on tradfi — that is, the traditional or mainstream financial market, i.e. stocks, bonds, national treasuries, national, global, or regional economies, etc.

You can find queryable data on public health at many sources. Here is a large repo of public data sets. We encourage you to find your own sources for this challenge!

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

Off-chain bounty submissions can make use of various publishing tools, such as Jupiter Notebooks, Google Data Studio, Google Collab, Rpubs, Kaggle, and more.  Dashboards should be organized in a way that is presentable to a general audience.  When possible, the full code should be hidden from readers.

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more (accurate) detail and the higher quality your dashboard (organization, method documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for a bounty)

Analysts in non-compliance with our policy on plagiarism may be exposed on Discord and see their xMetric slashed.

Open Analytics - 13. Osmosis,Season 3 - Batch 29,13,Intermediate,Osmosis,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Osmosis data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like “Open Analytics Dashboard”
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any bounty program).
- Re-submit prior work with only minimal updates.

Analysts in non-compliance with our policy on plagiarism may be exposed on Discord and see their xMetric slashed.

Create a dashboard diving into the key growth metrics of Exchange Art over time. How has the marketplace grown over time and how does that compare to the general NFT growth on Solana? Does it appear that 1-of-1 art is popular among many users on Solana, or is it primarily collected by select individuals? Are most users on Exchange Art whales or art lovers or both? 

Are there any unique purchasing behavior patterns that you see out of wallets that buy art on Exchange Art? What does the average price look like on Exchange Art and is there more of an appetite for high end pieces? 

How does the holding period of NFTs bought on Exchange Art compare to that of Magic Eden? Are users truly collecting or are they still interested in short term flipping? What wallets have been most profitable on Exchange Art and what has their strategy been so far? 

Note any other unique purchasing behavior that you find.

Open Analytics - 12. Osmosis,Season 3 - Batch 26,12,Intermediate,Osmosis,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Osmosis data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like “Open Analytics Dashboard”
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any bounty program).
- Re-submit prior work with only minimal updates.

Analysts in non-compliance with our policy on plagiarism may be exposed on Discord and see their xMetric slashed.

Open Analytics - 9. Osmosis,Season 3 - Batch 22,9,Beginner,Osmosis,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Osmosis data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any bounty program).
- Re-submit prior work with only minimal updates.

Analysts in non-compliance with our policy on plagiarism may be exposed on Discord and see their xMetric slashed.

Open Analytics - 7. Ethereum,Season 3 - Batch 19,7,Intermediate,Ethereum,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Ethereum data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?

The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:

- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:

- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any bounty program).
- Re-submit prior work with only minimal updates.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

-How do you raise your dashboard score?
The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for a bounty)

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

-How do you raise your dashboard score?
The more accurate, detailed and the higher quality your dashboard (presentation, methodology, documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for a bounty)

Ultimate Fifa+ Collect Dashboard,Season 3 - Batch 13,2,Intermediate,Ultimate Fifa+ Collect Dashboard,"We’ve reached the final round of the Flipside World Cup and to come full circle we will be looking at how the Fifa+ Collect project on Algorand has progressed. The goal is to create a dashboard to allow users to monitor the minting and secondary sales of each collection. Some things to include:

Track mints and secondary sales over time broken out by collection:

- Number of mints/secondary sales
- USD Volume of mints/secondary sales
- Number of wallets

Track the number of each rarity minted in each collection

Track the likelihood of minting each rarity for each collection (Tip: The editions field gives the total supply of the NFT and DO-##. The ## is the card number in the collection, so DO2-38 is card 38 in Drop 2 which will have a supply).

Give a breakdown of secondary sales for the rarity in each collection:

- Number of sales
- Total USD volume
- Average sale per rarity.
- List the most valuable cards in each collection based on secondary sales

Include any other data you think would be useful to a user wanting to mint or buy a pack in the marketplace: some things to consider are card breakdown based on event, year, player, score, or countries.

Tip: Each pack that is minted includes 3 cards.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score? 
The more (accurate) detail and the higher quality your dashboard (organization, method documentation, readability), the better your chances of scoring well. Here are a few rules of thumb for Open Analytics bounties:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for a bounty)

"Hacks, Scandals and Scams - 7. Flipside Crypto Bounty Farmers",Season 3 - Batch 3,7,Intermediate,Flipside Crypto Bounty Farmers,"Question Details

Through its bounty program, Flipside Crypto pays analysts for their insights and data analytics. Can you track down bad actors who ""farm"" Flipside rewards? Look for participants that collect multiple times for the same bounty or hunt. For instance, you might discover that different addresses transfer all of their token incentives to the same address. If these addresses are generating the same dashboards or finishing the same hunts, they might be bounty farmers. To find these bounty farmers, you are free to employ any means that is both legal and reasonable. Because it may harm their reputation, we advise you not to publish users' identities unless you are confident they are bounty farmers.

The collapse and bankruptcy filing of Three Arrows Capital has led to speculation about the fate of their Starry Night Capital, a collection of valuable NFTs assembled in 2021. On October 5th it was announced that the fund will be liquidated.

Estimate the current value of 3AC's NFT collection holdings in USD based on floor prices and other available information. Show how price has changed in USD terms over the last six months as the crypto market has collapsed, and how this compares to the collection's peak.

Provide additional insight on liquidity of the NFTs, and how their sale may influence the current market: if liquidators want to sell immediately, could this cause a dip in floor prices? Are there any trends suggesting holding may be a better option for long term value of specfic NFTs?

At a minimum, focus on items in 3 NFT collections (such as CryptoPunks, Fidenza, or anything else you find interesting). The top submissions will analyze the value of the entire Starry Night Capital portfolio and highlight several of the most interesting NFTs.

Starry Night Capital's NFT portfolio can be found here:

xMETRIC Masters Exclusive Bounty -- do not submit if you are not an xMETRIC Master!

If you are one of xMETRIC Masters and love working with new and challenging data, this one is for you!

MetricsDAO's data curation team has recently completed the first milestones in curating Terra Data: releasing core tables on blocks, transactions, messages, and labels. You can find these tables in Flipside Crypto's database as terra.core.

Now we invite xMETRIC Masters to bring in your expertise and dive into Terra data. Use your skillset to uncover interesting takeaways and build impactful dashboards. Pick any direction you want -- the top dashboards will dive into a topic that fits one or several of the following:

- impactful
- creative/unusual
- valuable to the protocol and/or the broader Terra ecosystem
- diving into a specific angle or a current trend
- making advanced use of the data that most will only query when future ez Terra tables are released (see the roadmap: https://metricsdao.notion.site/Terra-2-0-Data-Curation-Planning-930fcefd2c79439591e977b3e42ce288)

If you have at least 2,000 xMETRIC (the current xMETRIC Masters threshold at the time of this bounty) you are eligible to participate. Tweet your dashboard to emphasize interesting insights that you uncover, and tag @MetricsDAO!

Using the  nft.mints table on Dune V2, select one or a few recent project mints and determine how “successful” they were. 

How success is defined is up to you! You could look at: volume of ETH spent, number of NFTs minted, unique addresses minting the project, fees spent in ETH by minters.

For some above and beyond work, follow the project in the  nft.trades   table on Dune V2 - how did the project fare post-mint?

Finally, for a challenge one could look to  ethereum.transactions   or   ethereum.logs   on Dune V2 for failed mint transactions.

Was this a popular project? Did users burn ETH trying to mint, only to have their transactions fail? What advanced insights can we derive by going directly to the transactions?

Goldfinch - 1. Borrower Pool Analysis,,1,Advanced,Borrower Pool Analysis,"This bounty must be claimed and is exclusive to xMetric Masters.

Create a dashboard that provides key statistics on each Borrower Pool on Goldfinch. A complete submission will include all of the following metrics, and refresh regularly with the latest data. You can also provide additional information and insight that you believe would be helpful for the protocol and other users of this tool.

Metrics

- Pool information: Pool name, Pool size (amount of principal currently drawndown), Funded date, and Junior / Senior split.
- Payment status: Next payment due date, Next payment amount, Payment status (is late or on time).
- Payment history: Total interest paid, Total principal paid, % of payments that have been on time (within grace period). Hint (to determine % of payments that have been on time within grace period):

While MetricsDAO is open to all data providers, this particular part of the question may be more difficult to answer with Dune -- the constraint is that you need to know what the grace period is at the time of each payment. You can find the grace period tracked within the GoldfinchConfig smart contract, under the term LatenessGracePeriodInDays.

Note: Please include the development of an API so the Goldfinch team can add this dashboard to their website! The data used to build the dashboards must be accessible through APIs (ex: flipside velocity query / thegraph api) so that the Goldfinch team can potentially fork the queries / apis to build dashboards on https://goldfinch.finance/

The dashboard layout should progress vertically within a single column. It may be best to show each pool using a dropdown menu (using parameters if publishing on Flipside).

Open Analytics - 39. Optimism,,39,Intermediate,Optimism,"Submit a deep dive dashboard that explores a specific topic in detail using Optimism data.

Open Analytics (OA) bounties are bounties without specific prompts, just a direction and a reward. It’s your chance to have your brain follow your heart — got a spark of interest, or a loose thread, or a weirdly-specific question gnawing at the back of your mind? Follow it as far as you can!

How do you raise your dashboard score?
Your chances of doing well are increased if your dashboard is more precise and of higher quality (organization, methodology, documentation, and readability). Here are a few general guidelines for Open Analytics challenges:

DO:
- Give your dashboard a specific and relevant title
- Go deep into a topic and find creative/unusual data or paradigms
- Find macro and/or micro trends within a particular group or platform
- Ask weirdly-specific questions
- Consider trends, news and hot topics of the past day(s), week(s), month(s)
- Consider what info the platform’s core team and users would find valuable
- Organize your dashboard so it’s easy to read through
- Explain your methods clearly and check for mistakes (grammatical or statistical)
- Consider what media (text/visual) and chart types best fit a certain metric/data point
- Tweet your dashboard and/or make a thread about conclusions you may draw.

DON’T:
- Submit a dashboard with a generalized title like ""Open Analytics Dashboard""
- Make an overview/surface-level dashboard
- Chart only basic data (# of transactions, users, validators, etc) Include inaccurate or false information
- Copy other peoples’ work
- Double-dip (submit a dashboard you’ve already submitted for any other bounty program)

Basis of Payment:
To be eligible for payment.
1. The submission must be sent before the deadline indicated on the bounty page.
2. The submission must score a minimum of 8 points according to the Evaluation Criteria.
3. The first ranked submission must have a score of 10 or higher to be eligible for higher payout amounts.
