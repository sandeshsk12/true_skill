- <--review-delimiter-->Nice Dashboard, It's really dense (In Information) but thanks to the format, the text is easy to read!, answers all the questions, and gives insight in how to improve the subject (Loansnap) at the end.

Some Visualizations could improve for example in ""Slices (NFT) Stats"" the Big Number chart with ""Mint Price"" misleads because is the total volume of the mint instead of the mint price, or the ""Bacon & bHOME..."" chart in ""General Stats"" one of the results is ""Undefined"", Finally the Swaps charts could be more clear explaining that is the Swap USD Volume Showed, at first I thought the charts were about Swaps (The transaction) because neither the title or the Y axis   says ""Swap Volume / Swap USD Volume / $USD "".

Adding Swap/Transfer Activity (TXs) could be helpful for the tokens too.

Narrative could improve in a way that the first tab guides more easily the reader, like before giving the Long story of everything maybe giving them a TL;DR of everything (Loansnap, the tokens, the NFT, Bacon protocol, their relations, in what blockchain is located, to give the reader a base of what is going to see in the dashboard) like ""Loansnap Ecosystem"" but shorter.

 Chart titles are enough to explain the content, and explaining them again in the observation text overlaps the key insights.

The conclusion could improve explaining if Near Social Usage is growing up or not in this year for example, instead of using the same words as the Subtitle of the dashboard has.

The Subtitle guides the reader in what is the goal of the dashboard, having the results there doesn't make too much sense.

The parameters are a risky gamble, it allows the users to look at the data in more and differents ways but it also misleading, although they're explained it isn't enough for a non-flipside user to understand how they work.

For example the initial date parameter, doesn't affect the chart ""Time Analysis on New Profile"", what about ""param_tWRc"" it doesn't have an explanation.

I need to go to the Introduction tab everytime to remember how the parameters works, in my opinion the tabs that are affected by the Parameters should have at the top an explanation on how the parameters works, which charts of the tab are affected and how to properly use them.

Don't worry about the Flipside New app bugs, but is always nice to give a proper warning too.

The Methodology miss the chance to use the same Titles the dashboard has afterwards to separate each section, like ""We're going to review Near Social performance on differents sections, Growth Metrics: (and then put the goal of this section or the data that is shown)"" doing that is more easy for the reader to understand the goal of the dashboard, and then the conclusion can answer the question or summary each section.

Using Acronyms is valid but in the first instance they appear is better to wrote them entirely like ""Daily Active Users (DAU)""

The analysis is nice and provide context of the results, churn rate is an interesting metric to have!!

 <--review-delimiter-->This dashboard is one of the few if not the only one that tries to provide an explanation of the explosive growth of Users in Near Social giving an interesting and appealing narrative for the reader.

The Methodology could improve by explaining more than only the Dashboard Method, adding for example the data source of the inspiration this submission has to claim that ETHDenver is the cause for the explosive growth.

If the Methodology is at the first tab with the introduction and then moving the explanation of the sections there, it would be better so now the Methodology can explain all:

Dashboard Method + Dashboard Sources/Inspiration + Dashboard Structure (Tabs Explanation). and then the only missing piece will be the Dashboard Objective which could be a Question powered by the good Narrative of the Submission.

With a clear Objective, the Dashboard could end with a conclusion using the Narrative and Objective from the Introduction plus the data results to leave one of the strongest impressions to the reader which is going to leave the dashboard understanding that ETHDenver was the key behind the Success of the recent growth the app had.

The Visualizations for the Ranking could improve to be more understandable for the reader.

I really like that the dashboard refers all the data sources (Images, Definitions and Data), that give a lot of professionalism points, but the Grammar of the dashboard takes up your professionalism points.

The Methodology is really good, explaining everything but it takes a lot of time to write all of that so here are tips to improve your methodology.

The Methodology needs to explain the objective of the dashboard and also how the dashboard is made, so instead of having a tab with the methodology the dashboard could have the Methodology in the introduction, meanwhile the introductions explains the concepts/definitions/context, the methodology is where you can create an Objective/Goal/Question to entice the reader and give them a clarity of what the dashboard is about.

The purpose that all the tabs have, could be used in the methodology to explain each section, and finally explain all the data sources the submission used such as Flipside tables other Dashboards or Web3 Articles.

The Sections needs to be short instead of ""1. Analyze profile creations and edits"" it should be ""Profile""

Analysis need to consider the context of the subject, and have a clear narrative/story-telling, instead of ""as mentioned above... the number of users who craeted profile is less then increased and on Mar 5, 20233 ...the slope of the chart increased very much.""  it simply could be ""Near Social User Usage seems to increase over time with a strong spike on Mar 5, 2023""

Finally In the conclusion take the Narrative that the Methodology has with the dashboard Objective/Goal/Question and finish it using the results!.",,,"7231,7232,7233",https://twitter.com/aazarei1999/status/1633622339257597952?s=20,0xC2292dE8d7932C2E8b03BDeA630D531275f5F480,aazarei1999@gmail.com

If you want to do that, just also use the current price for ETH, though joining with a price chart and using amounts at the time of the donation, would be more relevant and worth doing.

I might think about which stats and charts are most important and consider changing/ eliminating some of them.
I may be weird, but two things I was curious about were the distribution of owners by the number of tokens held (you showed the top 30)and the cost to mint, grouped by name length.  I hate to encourage people to say more about the project, that they are writing about these days, as folks tend to err on the TMI side, but I would suggest a little more background on the minting/ sales process.

A few insights:

The analysis includes the period up to 2018, the data is not very recent. If we consider this analysis from the side of practical use (the conclusion says that this analysis can be useful for potential home buyers or investors to make informed decisions), then it is not entirely relevant. Or it is possible to describe why this period of time is interesting for analysis.

Visualization is not always easy to read. For example, in ""Mean price for groups"" the x-axis label is not clear visible.

Few insigths:

The description and charts indicate that the analysis is for 2023 (from January to December), however, now it's only March 2023

On widgets, it is better to round numbers to improve perception.

It would be great to analyze valuable metrics such as: median price per square meter depending on area/metro/attraction, median apartment price depending on the number of rooms and location, etc. instead of Total Worth. The ""Properties (Building name) Total Worth Based on Area's"" chart is not exactly easy to read.

It would also be interesting to analyze what percentage of real estate is in what status depending on the area.

In comparison ""Olympyics Medal Winnings of United States and Russia"", it's better to place metric values of both countries on the same chart, so it's easier to compare them.

It will also be better to improve the structure of the analysis. And some charts doesn't contain valuable information, they can be removed or replaced with others.

However, if you had compared it with other testnets, it would have been a 3/3 as this would be considered as above and beyond.

2/3 - More thoughts should have been given while writing insights. In the methodology section, you mentioned that you used statistical tools and techniques which were never shown in the analysis. Additionally, while you mention that network congestion is causing failure, you suggest a solution would be to offload transactions to layer 2, when the base is already a layer 2 solution.

2/3 - Some graphs could have been improved. For instance, why stack user count and transaction count in the same graph when they point to different insights? Also, the scatter plot used has no legends, making it difficult to decipher.

2.7/3 - Including a conclusion would improve the professionalism of the report, and would bring it to a 3/3.

Also, love the effort you put in for naming the contract, well done on that

For charts, it is better to write titles and also make a legend. Graphs should be easy to read without text. For example, it is possible to understand that the first charts show quantity and cumulative quantity, but this should be clear to anyone who will look at this analysis. It is also possible to hide cumulative values, but this possibility may not be obvious to everyone. And without hiding the cumulative values, the daily values are poorly readable, as a result, the graph does not have much value.

For some charts, it would be better to choose a different visualization method. For example, for a chart that shows the volume of investments by round, it is better to use a barchart instead of a linechart.

2.8 - The insights provided were strong and insightful, showcasing a deep understanding of the subject matter.

1.5 - While the author has put considerable effort into the visuals, there are areas that could be improved. For example, instead of having five big number graphs under squid, a single bar graph could be used to make it easier to read. The ""route taken"" section is also difficult to read and could benefit from more thought. Additionally, the scatter plot would have benefited from having a limited number of entries.

1.5 - Some of the graphs in the report were challenging to read, particularly the one showing the total daily number of users under Satellite. The y-axis is labeled as ""RANK,"" which can be confusing. It would have been more appropriate if the author had mentioned it as 'x number of days to crash.'

If this had been included, it would have received a score of 3/3. However, the report did provide good insights into Stargate finance that explored a previously unexplored area.

2.7 - The report provided strong and insightful insights, earning a score of 2.7/3.

2.7 - The graphs used were legible and easy on the eyes. The addition of color to distinguish between depeg and normal was a good choice. One point for improvement could be to choose between using only average or median, depending on what the author feels is most appropriate.

In addition, asked you to compare these bridges with other bridges like hop and etc but you only analyzed hop itself without any comparison. The positive point is you provide good comparison in comparing SVB and FTX collapse.<--review-delimiter-->2 - One important aspect of the prompt was to analyze the performance of the Squid router during the FTX collapse and SVB collapse. However, this was not addressed in the dashboard, leading to a lower score. It would have been better to include everything asked in the prompt or explain why it wasn't possible to do so. By doing this, the author could have received a higher score.

2 - While the author has put in considerable effort to derive insights from the data, they could have been stronger. Instead of simply describing the graphs, the author could have explained the trends seen in the data, such as why they might be increasing or decreasing. For instance, instead of saying that the data increased from x to 2x on 01-01-2022, the author could have discussed why this might have happened or how it relates to other factors.

2 - Some of the graphs in the dashboard are confusing due to unclear naming of legends, titles, and graph names. For instance, the ""Daily number bridge by different sources/destination"" graph is unclear about whether Ethereum is a source, destination, or both. By improving the naming of the graphs, the author could have received a higher score.

2- Readers can fully understand the analysis and its context.

I could not find the logical fault with the queries, but note, that when using the newBalance  of the DelegateVotesChanged event restricted to the last transaction, others have got ~3x amount of the your delegated totals. 
Also note that you were calculating the the daily delegated ARB by the latest balance of each address instead for the timeseries. This introduces an error if balances change. Another inconsistency I found was in the amount of delegators, in the first tally you found 66k delegator addresses, however later you found 112k.
The found the comparison of stats, especially the project usage stats interteresting. You might have expanded the discussion in that direction. Also, as you have noted, there is a very large difference between the number of delegating vs. non-delegating addresses, therefore using stats normalized to user may have been more informative.

A surprising, effective calculator to calculate the market dominance of solana and some other chains. Very nice CEX/DEX intro! The analysis should have been read back, begining of the sentence makes no sense. Unfortunately the query for total users was not correct. You actually queried the number of contracts associated with each dex and cex. This returns addresses such as pools. The values for CEX's is not so bad, because most of the cex associated addresses in the table are user deposit addresses (accidentally almost correct).
'Orca and Radiyum are the only DEXs with any volume'  Try using the swaps tables instad og the liquidity pool actions table. 6 Trillion daily volume is clearly not correct.  Also unfortunately, you mixed dex swaps into cex volumes.

The dashboard should aim to answer the question ""why"". Why are your findings significant? What questions do they answer? What can be done with your information, to influence decisions in the future?

Charts have overlapping meanings on the data represented. While the accuracy on the Polygon chain is a discrepancy with the data from Squid Developer's docs. Quickswap is supposed to be the main DEX in Polygonchain. However, there is no sign of Quickswap in the analysis.

For time analysis charts, it would be better to consider only the period that shows a significant trend. For example, December 2022 can be ignored due to the lack of activity during that period.

Some thoughts-

Wow- seemingly infinite information.. certaintly a FLOW hub! That said, try not to overwhelm the reader with information. An A+ dashboard should consist of 20 visuals- and no more. Here, you have 40+ just on the 1st tab.

Keep in mind who will be reading the dashboard, and taylor it to them. Think about answering ""the why"", and figuring out why this information is important to the reader, what they should do with it, and why it's worth their time to read it.

Watch the repition on the visuals- they are great, but some of them get repetetive. When holding the reader in mind, focus on what they will takeaway, and expand on that. Some of the information on the tables gets execessive on the 4th tab- just be mindful of the readers time, and what they are looking to get out of it.

Pay attention to the rubric- reviewers are supposed to take off points if analysts go over 20 in a dash. Its new, and this had a lot of good info in it, so I didnt penalize much at all, but for next time, keep it in mind.

Overall, incredible wealth of informaiton. Remove some of the clutter, add some anlaysis answering the ""why"", and this is an incredible dashboard.<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - The dashboard should avoid excessive explanation.

Also, proposers might not be the best factor to look for users, giving that the user in mind is not always the proposer of the transaction.

Nice visualizations.

Good attempt at trying to segmentate the users frecuency on the past months.

Did not try to find a reason for the spikes in user activitys.<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - Liked the tweet- but include a thread for max exposure/points. The dashboard provided a good overview of the chain, but didnt get into the weed or answer the quesito ""why"", as much as it did the what.

Ensure your dashboard is easy to read. Lots of your visuals have a plethora of objects in them, making it difficilut to decypher what is what.

You have some visuals that dont quite work- ""top 10 assets on swap by transaction"". The name is a little confusing, and the transaction percentage is not shown on the graphs.

Some graph types are incorrect. For the ""users on swap top 10 assets"" visual, that should be a bar chart, not line graph.

Overall, there is good information present in the dashboard. That said, it would benfeit from more time spent on orgnaization, less clutter, and better explanations to the reader

- That last one is really important. Readers look at these dashboards to learn from you. you put together a lot of good info, but didnt explain the meaning or signifiance behind any of it. So what that ATOM was a was swapped more often than another token. What does that mean for future decision making, either as a leader in the protocol or a small scale investor?

Make sure the ""what is osmosis"" chunk isn't Chat botted so obviously (haha). It tends to just take some words from various docs and push them together, and reads fairly robitically.

On many of the tabs (assets overview, trading, etc.) the visuals are there, but the reasoning is not (i.e. the ""why""). Why is the asset price over time decreasing? what does it mean?

Some of the visuals are confusing- ""popularity of superfluid staked assets in osmiosis over time""- the visual is fiarly clutttered and hard to read.

Overall, the dashboard shows a lot of information, but it is equally your job to explain the significance behind it.

Graph limits- dashboards should be limited to 20 visuals a piece.. and you have 30 on your swap tab alone :) For next time, try only using visuals that are key to understnadinng your primary argument/display of information. Additionally, this could be helped by reducing duplciate visuals (cum. volume $ per symbol vs. tot share of swappers per symbol).

The biggest thing- rememebr your audience! While many viewers will familiar with your data, they are reading it with the goal to learn. While the visuals are great, the meaning behind them is a little more open to interpretation than we would like. Try uncovering some trends/patterns in the data, and tell us what you think they mean! You have the great mind to uncover this stuff, but what good are a bunch of bones if the arciologist shapes them in the form of an airplane, but really it was a dinosaur? (analogies are a WIP).

While the observations at the bottom of the dashboard provide a quick summary of the information, what we're looking for is something that goes above and beyond the numbers- and answers the question ""why"". Why do these numebrs matter? who cares? what decisions could be made based off of them?

The narrative was the cherry on top to guide the reader through mango's history and movements. Nice work<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - First i'm going to list areas improvement for future dashboards, according to the new rubric:

Scorecards are important! Showing totals in the form of a scorecard helps the audience understnad the scope of the data- how much, where, and what

Including links to the data- although you linked the entire live dashbaord, going back and tracking the exact visual is a little more taxing than we'd like- try including links to directly to the code if possilbe.

Including snapshots of your tables aren't overly helpful- make sure to just include the visuals (which are designed to sum up the data nicely for a quick read through).

Dashboards are penalized if they have over 20 visuals. I counted 28, but the new rubric was jsut released, so just keep that in mind for next time!

Build on your visual showing the available capital. Was the collateral USD really negative for a majority of the protocols existance? Any thoughts, explanations, reasons?

Overall, the written portion of the dashboard showed immense attention t to detail- a truly elite understanding of the protocol.. keep it up! (also, nice twitter thread)<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - A comprehensive, professional and precise Mango Market analysis dashboard. 

Data visualization is concise and precise without any redundancy. Would prefer point form findings/explanation on several sections. To keep reader's attention afloat

The normalized distribution over time for different users from old mango versions was on point.
<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - First, I'm going to list several areas of improvment- please do not take any of this personally, just observations and notes to ensure you are getting the best feedback possible for next time:

Make sure your are doing more than just copy/pasting from the mango Docs in your explanations and liks portion.

You set the whale designation at $10k: seems a little light? When thinking of who really controls the volume in these protocols, in my opinion, it is the users depositing a lot more than that- no points off, but just think about it in your analysis of why we are tracking whale information in the first place.

You picked out the varying Mango success rate in your first tab- any ideas on why this was? Glitch in the protocol? Overload on activity? Exploratory research could be good here.

You have a ""mango actiosn by user type"" at the bottom of the 3rd tab. What is this visual showing? There are 2 axisis showing different numbers, and then a line running between them. What is the action type you are talking about?

For the enitre dash- its okay to fork another user's code, but there is an expectation that you use parts of it to improve your own work- and don't just use it as a copy/paste function.

Overall, the dashboard was informative, accurate, and interesting- just keep in mind these improvemnts for next time! (nice thread btw)<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - A comprehensive and concrete dashboard. However, there are several charts having overlapping meaning on data represented. 

Minor grammer/spelling mistake.

But that only reflects that they are in fact, whales.

Some key answers are provided. Overall, it gives a perspective onto what its been going inside Mango even if some not-so relevant data are provided.
<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - Visuals were well made, and the tabs were well organized. However, make sure to not overload the reader with information. Any given dashbaord wouldn't exceed more than 20 visuals total, and you had 18 on your liquidity analysis alone. In your findings text, a lot of it was just throwing back the numbers that the visuals showed- not explaining the how or the why. Moving forward, make sure to limit yourself to only the most telling visuals to maximize your points- but overall, great work! (and nice twitter thread)<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - Comprehensive dashboard. However,  certain charts have overlapping meanings of data represented. For example, the daily average charts on several metrics do not present any significant value to the reader.

Besides, there is no strong correlation between the NFT and events analysis on user behavior in the Mango market. The data seems to be redundant under the topic.

The cumulative metrics for growth are not being used correctly, they are just counting base activity and adding up to it.

It seems that the report is made in a vaccum, with no regards as to Mango recent pasts.

But, when the appropiate metrics are being used and the narrative accompanies it, the charts are nice and clear.<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - Top 10 platforms was a little wonky. Having the pie chart show 99+% of users using orca, then the bar chart which has a log scaled Y axis makes it kinda confusing as to what is going on. Try not to repeat visuals, especially if using different scales- and the entire user behavior page had a lot of visuals showing duplicate info, just visualized differently. For next time, try just using 1 visual, and then go into the details of explaining why in the written portion and segment it like that. I thought the comparison page was really strong, and had really insightful/meaningful/informative visuals. Really great work brining those to life. Another thing to think about for next time, is to have your analysis go above and beyond reguratating the numbers- try to get into the ""why"" in order to show significance. I nit picked a lot, but overall, great work! (Nice twitter thread)<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - The user behavior analysis does not fit well with the narrative for Mango Market.

Old users might be misguiding in this case, considering that Mango did have a previous version with old users.

Visualizations weren't always helpful.

But, leaving those points aside, it did provide an answer to the challenge question.<--review-delimiter-->hernandezngronk#7837 - A few notes for next time-

# of visuals- this should be limited to 20, unless they are expentionally and legitmately necessary to understand the scope of the project. While many were good some were unnecessary- do weekly transactions really show a different story than monthly? Can cumulative not be put on the same visual? 

    - If you are going to break it down by day of the week, why not explain the signiafance?

Calculations- does Drift have ~ $10 billion in perp volume, and Zeta only have $3mil?

Overall- a boat load of info! Just make sure to keep the audience in mind- readers are looking for information that adds to their knowledge and are looking for an answer to the question ""why?""

A fair amount of the visuals seem unnecessary- what is the distribution of users telling us? (4th graph down on the left column of the users tab).

Overall, nice work! just make sure not to sacrafice readability at the cost of information!<--review-delimiter-->Ramahar#4167 - Although the dashboard covers the objective of the bounty. However, the amount of charts presented have made it difficult for reader to digest.

Methodology- a brief methodology at the beginning of the dashboard would help the reader follow whats going on, and introduce them gently to the dashboard overall.

Whats the difference btetween create account and screat account with seed? Maybe that could be somewhere in the explanations?

What does the liquidity providers deposits show? What does the x axis represent here? How is the percent cumualtive total exceeding 100%, and what exactly is that number telling to the reader?

Tabs- use these to your advantage to keep a well kept and easily segmented dashboard.

Make sure to answer the entire question- protocol comparisons? (Drift, zeta?)

Confusion in visuals- you have an inflows portion of the dashboard (which goes negative?) but no outflows. Consistancy is king!

 No parameters for the dashboard. This is a problem as this feature was explicitly requested. Nevertheless a very solid beginner effort.

Introduction tab:
 Gameplan of the dashboard ..ok. Intro to Avalanche is superfluous. Methods define DAU as at least 1 tx every two weeks.,Typo in Methods: 'If a user had transactions within 14 weeks, I considered them active users on Avalanche.' that would be 14 days... no you actually filtered for users active at least 14 weeks in the last 7 months.

tab1 (active users):
 typo in the tabs name. You've excluded addresses in the dim labels table from the pool of users. I presume this is to filter out apps from the users, though it should have been stated explicitly. Though overly complicated, your queries are correct. Interesting insight on the generated total and average volume of new and active users. Days of the week: the colors would have been better used to display both new and active user volumes. Nevertheless, good effort!

 though not mentioned the query is now only considering token transfer type transactions (hence we only get token contracts). It is important that the title and the Y-axis states what is visible on a graph, In the top two graphs case neither tells that we are looking at unique user counts. This issue is even worse for the bottom two queries as there is no way to tell that we are talking about the average number of transactions/ active user for the top contracts.

Similar graph naming and Y-axis labeling issues. Correct insights reached, but note that the result would have been much different if you have not restricted the application labels to 'dex','defi','dapp'. Also note that the average you have calculated is not only per user but also per week as well. would be even better if the active/non-active comparison was direct and the colors between graphs were harmonsed to represent the same dApps..

So much care and proffessionalism had been laid into the layout of this dashboard, that it's unfortunate to have to deduct for technical errors. But the techincal errors are *severe* tot the point of unusability. This may be somehow a technical issue on my end, however I have to evaluate what I see. The detailed designed modular functionality of the app is cool... until one click on the apply parameters button with the default options. Then most graphs just don't load the ones that do, do so after a long time. (Evaluating with original state, subtracting from C & P for tabs with graphs that did not load.)

Introduction tab:
 Detailed but succint methodology and introduction to relevant terms. Visually appealing and professional. Much appreciated. 
Score weight 10% (I:3,C:3,V:3,P:3)

tab1 (Overview):
 Minor comment: please use custom, meaningful Y-axis labels. I find the previous/ new user split informative and helpful. Minor comment: this could have been combined with the previous graph, reducing the overall chartload of the tab. The cumulative line adds daily unique wallets, not unique wallets up to a given date. Major content error: there were 1.02 M unique wallets (SQL seems correct) since Jan 01 and 3.95 M unique new wallets in the same period on Avalanche. Both of these figures cannot be true. There are also several orders of magnitude more total txs made by new wallets than the total unique wallets. The insights/analysis is sectioned to the conclusions tab I'll be evaluating the relevant insights here... Significant increase in users in 2023, good (unfortunately this is the extent of the derived insights). (Daily distribution of wallets did not load) 
Score weight 27% (I:2,C:1.75,V:2.8,P:2.75)

tab2 (Contracts): Inner joins were used to join transactions to labels, resulting in the filtering of contracts to labeled contracts (minor). Meaning of column 'change rate' not defined clearly. Looking at the query, its definition does not make sense. Should be negative when previous wallets exceed current wallets and positive vica-versa. Usually the rate of change is normed to the earlier quantity. Further problem with the metric is that non-equal periods of time are compared. (The start time is arbitrary.) All of these problems can be easily fixed. Findings: Trader Joe indeed dominates the market in term of users. However the claim: ""50% of daily contract transactions are done for Trader Joe's"" is not substantiated with the presented data (while true). I cannot evaluate the claim regarding wAVAX as the graphs did not load after applying parameters. The value 'Total new Unique Wallets on Contract' is duplicated. Minor non-critical note: In order to measure retention one should measure the amount of time between transfers from the same address. The number of tx-s within the observed period does not necessarily translate to retention in time. One could tell, for example, on a given day what percentage of users have been retained for a week or month. (Five graphs did not load after clicking apply)

The by app breakdown's interpretation walks over which dApp dominated the market in which time period. The graphs for avax token transfer distribution over time by dApps reveal that, these type of applications have periods when one application controls most users.

Based on the queries the used definition is a user with at least one sent transaction in the observed period.

However I fail to see why you chose to assign a user to the hour with the least - as opposed to the most activity. You have also hard coded the last distribution to report on users that were active 6 out of the last 7 days. While stating that these are the active users of this analysis, I did not see such definition. I'm subtracting a bit for filtering to the least used hour, but it may be something I don't understand.

minimal parameters (but it works!) Major issue detailed under tab5.

Introduction tab: Nice detailed, interesting intro on AVAX and use case of the presented metrics. Methods sub-tab: 'you can access real-time data on the number of active users on the Avalanche network and their geographical distribution' (Was this GPT?) I don't know how geographical distribution got in here. 'You can also use our dashboard to gain insights into the performance of the network, such as the block time and the confirmation time for transactions.' No you cannot, there is no such data in there. Can't you be bothered to read your text generators output?!? Not to mention the boilerplate texts are cheesy. However, your methodology failed to mention your actual used definition daily active user (ie.: users active on 4 out of 7 days from any given calendar week (which is a metric prone to step-like artifacts as opposed to 7-day sliding window))
Score weight 10% (I:2,C:0,V:2.5,P:0)

tab1 (Active users across the chain): Y-axis default, but legible. Insight: majority of users are Non-DAU and their number is increasing. '..with almost 50,000 users consistently active on the platform.. ' More like ~35k, but ok. A decreasing number of DAUs is driving an increasing proportion of the network traffic, ok. ' Over the past six months, more than 6,000 ...' it was 3 months. The rate of new DAU growth is increasing since March, the same time as the total number of DAUs is decreasing, interesting.
Score weight 18% (I:2.5,C:2.8,V:2.0,P:1.8)

tab2 (contracts): minor: an inner join was used to join to dim_contracts which results in a filtering of the results to labeled contracts in the DB. Major: note the following for the week of Jan30 (using tab1): #DAU:43k #non-DAU:109k, but #DAU using contracts:225k. Strange, isn't it? This is due to double counting the 43k multiple times over when summing the different contracts. The same multi-counting issue occurs in chart 2 for category 'Others'. Note, that this does not cause problems when counting txs. chart 3: hide the legend if you don't want to give the column a name (undefined). Insight 1 is ignored for the above detailed reasons. 'the most commonly used contract by weekly DAUs is Joe LP token, with around 30,000 users, and this number has remained relatively constant ' sure if, you take a 50% decrease as remaining relatively constant. (The trend was hard to see due to the fake 120k Others signal). The insight on the tx volume rank order is valid. Double counting issue with the new users as well. Score weight 18% (I:1.25,C:1.25,V:2.0,P:1.5)

tab3 (layer2s): Would have been nice to tell the user that you've meant users interacting with contracts labeled as layer2. No double counting. Insights: '... with an average of around 2,000 weekly DAUs ' Are we looking at the same chart? on my end *every* point of chart 1 is above 2000 (min 3.91k). 'Multichain is the most popular platform, with over 1,000 weekly DAUs and a recorded spike of 3,000 DAUs in a single week' And that was the only week when it was the most popular. According to your chart in every other week stargate and layerzero exceeded it in number of DAUs. '... a stable average of around 10,000 weekly transactions ' I must be seeing double, the min I see on chart three is 24.4k tx. With the new users section I'm seeing the same numbers as you are. Valuable insights on the origin of new users to layer2s and the way they explain the time series of new users. Score weight 18% (I:2,C:1.5,V:2.25,P:1.5)
tab4 (NFTs): Good, no duplication, minor Y-axis issue, but:succinct and good insights on what happened on the NFT market and why! You also correctly determine the rank order of the projects, however the number of DAUs of Chikn is trending downwards (minor correction). 
Score weight 18% (I:2.9,C:1.5,V:2.25,P:2.5)

tab5 (DEX): Though the duplication error present with the contracts is not here, there is clearly something wrong, 142K DAUs for the January 30 week and there should be no more than 42k. I suspect that the error originates from the join with the decodedeventlogs as this will list all internal calls, possibly multiplying the counted events. Since the same technique was used in the earlier tabs, the effect is general to all results. (revising all C scores to max 1.5) Insights: 'dropping from almost 150k ': max was 121k

good work.<--review-delimiter-->Ali3n#8546 - The dashboard is excellent and provides a comprehensive overview of various bridges in Avalanche. However, some charts could be excluded or merged to avoid repetition. Additionally, there are two bridges for Squid (Squid and squid) with different stats which can be confusing for the reader. Overall, well-done!<--review-delimiter-->banbannard#7857 - Love the dashboard!
It would be preferable if the x-axis on User Breakdown charts was sorted in ascending order.

Consider adding further analysis on the KPI to appropriately answer and go deeper into the topic. <--review-delimiter-->banbannard#7857 - Good effort. However, there's potential for a deeper analysis that could uncover more valuable insights. The dashboard's presentation style leaves room for enhancement. Including an introduction would provide a more comprehensive and engaging narrative.<--review-delimiter-->marqu#1790 - It is unclear from the dashboard whether the aim was to display the trading fees or the transaction fees, but the Jupiter Fees indicator ultimately sums the lifetime transaction fees paid to the Solana blockchain on all their transactions if their first or last used program is Jupiter. This is incorrect for both situations.

In the Daily and Total Swaps chart, there is an attempt to get Jupiter limit orders from the solana.core.factswaps table that returns 0 rows. This is due to the swaps table used does not classify executed limit orders by the limit programid, which the author is able to correctly identify in other parts of the dashboard.

Overall inconsistency of programs included as part of Jupiter activity. Some charts include the Jupiter limit program (Daily and Total Swaps), while others do not (DAU). More inconsistency and inaccuracy in the data resulting from the filtering of successful transactions. While most charts correctly include only successful transactions as part of the actual activity of the exchange, the ones focusing on BONK and GUAC do not, resulting in overinflated numbers and a misleading perception over the impact of the assets in the overall activity of the platform as displayed throughout the rest of the dashboard.

Swap success rate section does not filter the data to transactions made on Jupiter.",,,"11782,11783,11784",https://twitter.com/Jhanlycn/status/1656749283323047936,,jnguyen.cn@gmail.com

The human/bots separation does a good job of highlighting the difference between the performance of the platform under normal usage versus transaction spamming and sheds more light over the cause of the high failure rate in the overall transactions count.

Although the token/pair/dex breakdowns are great and offer a detailed view of the platform, as a KPI dashboard it is important to have the aggregated stats easily visible, such as the period/daily volume, swaps, users.

The User Debut section is a bit confusing due to the naming similarity. It can be hard to distinguish between v1 of the UI from the v1 of the aggregator program, especially when being displayed next to each other.

Great work diving into the inner instructions to retrieve the programs of all the dexs used as part of a swap route and attributing transactions back to them. You could have probably used a very similar technique to get the amounts swapped at each of those dexs too.

Despite its best efforts however, the methodology for the Jupiter routes is incorrect, and so is the data presented in the two charts using it. The used query returns the transactions that contain more than one separate swaps and they are not the dexs that Jupiter routes its swaps through.

Minor typos such as “Jupitet”.

The “pairs attracting new users” is a good way of offering insight into how some tokens or pairs can impact swap activity.

Storytelling that is well-defined and easy to understand. However, in this dashboard, the swap volume KPI is bigger than the actual volume, resulting in anomalies in other charts. The data in the swap growth/volume/swappers growth tables (total = 24 hours ago) is misleading. <--review-delimiter-->banbannard#7857 - A great dashboard with a wide range of topics. However, there appears to be a data error, when Start_Date is filtered to be as early as Jupiter's inception, total volume shows 89B USD, which is significantly higher than actual total volume. Table has data error too (total and 24Hrs have the same value)<--review-delimiter-->marqu#1790 - The overall dashboard has a very clean layout, information is clearly displayed and the chart elements remain focused on the three main aspects relevant to the exchange: Swaps, Volume, Users.

In the case of the observations on the high fail rate, even though you might find some explanations written somewhere, it is important to back them up with data in the dashboard.

The Jupiter Routes query is a very good attempt at mapping the routes used by the aggregator, but unfortunately it assumes the intermediary swap programs will only be at the index 0 or 3, whereas multiple swaps can and are very often used when executing a swap. Therefore the used queries only return the first step of the route, leaving out a large portion of the other swaps being made.

The KPI has been stated clearly. However, the question about the DEXes that Jupiter pulls from remains unanswered. The DEX comparison is an excellent idea, but Jupiter is a swap aggregator; it chooses the best way to swap from the DEX route, therefore the metrics should not be compared among the Jupiter and other DEXs. <--review-delimiter-->banbannard#7857 - Awesome work! However, this question is less like Jupiter vs other DEXes, but what dexes does Jupiter pull from the most (since Jupiter is an aggregator, it aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXes, including Orca, Raydium, etc..). Capitalisation in chart titles is inconsistent. Some spelling mistakes include Commers (rather than Comers). Overall well done.<--review-delimiter-->marqu#1790 - The dashboard covers most of the questions in the challenge but not all of them. The submission does not answer the question of what dexes Jupiter pulls from the most, or which coin inspired the most change in user behaviour. The dashboard contains a token breakdown of volume, but the analysis does not go beyond listing the trading volume and mentioning the continued performance of the already established SOL, USDC and USDT across the ecosystem.

On the completed side of the challenge, the submission comes short of successfully wrapping things up in a professional manner and has typos such as “new commers” and “overtime”, unlabeled chart axes, and unusually named charts such as “Some Metrics”.

In the “Key Insights” section of the Introduction tab, there is mention of “the platform's other offerings, such as margin trading, yield farming, and staking”, but these are not offered by Jupiter, and are obviously not backed by any data presented in the dashboard either.

Despite not having answered all the questions, the dashoard is overwhelmed by the 50+ charts it contains across multiple tabs. Many of the charts concerning crossover are beyond the scope of the challenge, such as the “top nft platforms interacted by Jupiter users” and don't add much value.

The Dex tracker tool, while possibly valuable as a standalone tool, is confusing and beyond the scope of the challenge.

The swap volume numbers being reported in the dashboard have several daily values with values many times over what the market usually experiences and far off from the values reported by any other sources. The queries need to account for or otherwise filter out possible pricing errors that impact the accuracy and reliability of the charts.

The Fees section reports the right data, but the Findings section next to it indicates that these transaction fees are somehow an indicator of Jupiter’s financial health and sustainability, even though those fees are paid to the validators and never reach Jupiter in any way.

The dashboard contains 30 charts, including a section dedicated to comparing Jupiter with its indirect competitors.

Despite having a reported volume over 10 times greater than the rest of the market, the conclusion goes on to remark about these highly traded tokens.

Probably for a similar reason, the reported monthly volume for the Jupiter aggregator is much higher than it is likely to be true, and far off the values reported by any other source.

 <--review-delimiter-->SocioCrypto#1741 - The dashboard is comprehensive and well-organized, providing valuable metrics and examining the healthiness of BENQi from various perspectives. However, there is a need for modifications in the measurement or definition of metrics related to users. Specifically, the current measurement of user age is the difference between the time of their first transaction and the present time which may not accurately reflect the active age of users. We do not know if those users are still active or not. The current metric appears to be correlated with the daily new users, which is not directly related to user age. Some of visuals need minor modifications.

Although the null fields are null by design, this can only be interpreted correctly if someone decided to inspect the underlying query.

- When using the pre and post balances to calculate volume, the query includes other expenses that are not part of the trading volume, such as the transaction fees and the cost to create the associated accounts often times needed to make a trade. The impact may seem small, but this is a type of discrepancy that scales with the volume of transactions.
- The base query is very close to being perfectly accurate, but it includes some transactions that are not actual sales.
- Strong submission overall, with all the required metrics and an easy to follow layout. The charts are well titled and charts have useful axis labels.
- Observations such as that a greater number of buyers than seller “means it is the same set of users that are selling” should be backed up with data as the statement is not necessarily true.
- The query used for the distribution of wallets by the number of NFTs owned double counts users if they made a different number of purchases through different functions (which they are not in control of). Additionally, the query considers as “owned” any token that was purchased, disregarding the possibility of it being sold or transferred.

- The base query captures transactions that are not sales.
- The “Share of trade type on attraction of new users” actually counts all the distinct buyers and sellers in the period instead of the intended purpose suggested by the title.

- Some charts have confusing titles that make it difficult to interpret the data they display.
- The addition of activity and tx success rate by human vs. bot traders is a nice initiative. However, the entire section does not make it clear that all the transactions involving the Elixir program are being included, which is different from the stated purpose of the dashboard to track the trading activity on the platform. This can lead to misleading conclusions.
- A few of the charts are redundant, such as “Total collections on trade type”. Other charts are redundant because the same information is then found in other charts and tables.
- In the Users tab, the top buyers table has a misleading column of “First trade” which displays the first trade of the user for the selected time frame. This can be misleading as it usually meant to indicate when the user first joined the platform regardless of the period observed. The rest of the metrics are inaccurate dues to the issue with the base query already addressed.

- The abundance of data, sometimes laid out in a way that makes it unclear what time frame is being used, or what time unit is used for segmenting it, makes the overall dashboard very hard to follow. The dashboard attempts to be an exhaustive source of data, but in doing so, it is actually making it much harder to find any actionable or insightful data.
- The “Elixir First Day” metric is misleading as it actually shows the first day of the trader only during the selected time frame.
- The dashboard unexpectedly switches between the time period selected by the parameters and a smaller time frame of 30 days. This is only revealed in the Observations section next to these charts, which makes it confusing and hard to follow.
- Last days top NFTs and top collections are a good example of sections that could be condensed into a much smaller number of charts. Without any other metrics of insight of particular interest, this data is also much more timely available on the Elixir platform.

- Charts are sometimes segmented by day and other times by week, making it difficult to track the performance of different metrics over a particular period.
- The old/new users chart only tracks the first use of an address within the time frame of the query, creating a distorted view of the platform’s user acquisition that varies with the period you look at.

- The use of color for text can make it difficult to read depending on the light/dark mode used by the user, but the use of red and blue text next to each other is generally a bad design which makes it tiring to read.
- The all-time metrics in the Introduction tab is a nice idea, but make sure it is more obvious they are all-time metrics. Currently it’s only mentioned in passing in the Parameter Instruction section. As for the metrics, a table with all the metrics would be much easier to read and interpret.
- The use of big number cards is excessive.
- The base query does not include transactions that don’t follow the exact structure outlined in the query and includes transactions that are not actual trades. This impacts the accuracy of all the charts that use it.
- The dashboard presents 204 new users but only 35 daily active users in the last month. Another problematic metric is the number of collections traded in the period, which is presented as over 2k.
- Over 2M in trading volume for the 30 days period is also very inaccurate. It is possible some improper joins result in doubled values.
- The Labs Token section is based on a false premise. Traders don’t also receive tokens when making a trade. Instead they are tokens Elixir uses to represent fractions of the NFT being traded and are either burned or minted based on the tx.

- The methodology section contains no methodology. It’s only an outline of the dashboard and its content.
- The overall stats charts are vague about the data they’re displaying. Is the average volume per day/week/user or what else?
- Base query copied from Dune query (https://dune.com/queries/1865793/3072808) with no attribution.
- The base query used does not include all transactions if they don’t follow the exact structure the query assumes.
- When using the pre and post balances to calculate volume, the query includes other expenses that are not part of the trading volume, such as the transaction fees and the cost to create the associated accounts often times needed to make a trade.
- The new users chart count the new users for the observed period, not users that are new to the platform. This creates a distorted and shifting view of new users acquisition that changes with the observed time frame
- Collections trading volume includes transactions that are not trades and double counts amounts that are transferred multiple times within a transaction.

The summary is good.

There are many unrelated charts.

The focus is not on the impact before and after listing on Coinbase.

It is better to provide your insight, the statistics of each chart are visible and insight is important.

It's a good effort.<--review-delimiter-->Pine_Moe!#8905 - The dashboard demonstrates a good level of effort invested. However, it would be beneficial to avoid including unnecessary charts that do not directly relate to the submission's objectives. To enhance its effectiveness, it is recommended to shift the focus towards examining the impact of Coinbase listing on the OSMO token, rather than providing a general overview of Osmosis pools. A useful approach could involve dividing the analyzed time-frame into two periods: before and after the listing, allowing for the identification of notable changes or trends. Moreover, providing insightful interpretations of the charts and offering detailed analysis of the data would greatly enhance the dashboard's quality. Overall, there is room for improvement to make the dashboard more impactful. <--review-delimiter-->Ali3n#8546 - Good effort. However, it would be beneficial to avoid including irrelevant charts that are not necessary for the submission. Additionally, instead of providing an overview of Osmosis pools, it would be more effective to focus on the impact of Coinbase listing on the OSMO token. Consider dividing the time-frame into before and after the listing to highlight any notable changes or trends. Try to write some insights about charts and descript what's going on on them, instead of just saying what are the charts about.

All questions have been answered. However, I would argue that, while Mad Lads had a more successful launch in terms of sales volume and average price, this does not always imply long-term success or value. This is due to the fact that initial sales volume and price may not always predict future performance. Without more context, the conclusion that Solana NFT has entered a new era because of Mad Lads' initial numbers may be a bit overstated. Great job overall.

However, the abundance of over 40 charts in the dashboard might prove overwhelming for the reader (e.g the bottom part of 'Compare with other projects' tab). A more streamlined approach, focusing on the most insightful ones would likely be beneficial. Moreover, it seems that the concept of contrasting the initial 30 days of Mad Lads and DeGods was adapted from h4wk's dashboard. It's essential to give due credit for this. The summary mentions 'The share of Whales among purchasers of the Mad Lads is considerably high and NFT Whales wants to collect this collection to gain more profit due to the origin of the Mad Lads project.' More context is required here for the reader to understand the specifics of the Mad Lads project's origin that could make it profitable for Whales to accumulate. Some spelling error - Mad Lad.
